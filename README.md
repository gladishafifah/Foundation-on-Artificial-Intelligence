# Foundation on Artificial Intelligence 🚀

Welcome to the **Foundation on Artificial Intelligence** repository! 🎉 This repository was created to learn the fundamentals of AI through two main projects that develop our ability to understand, apply, and visualize data. Let's learn more about each project below.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository contains two main projects:
1. [Project 1: Denominations](https://github.com/gladishafifah/Ch1.Foundation-on-Artificial-Intelligence/blob/master/01_02_KelompokA_Gladis%20Hafifah.ipynb)
2. [Project 2: Analytics and Data Visualization](https://github.com/gladishafifah/Ch1.Foundation-on-Artificial-Intelligence/blob/master/01_03_KelompokA_Gladis%20Hafifah.ipynb)

Each project has its own directory containing code, documentation, and other additional materials.
